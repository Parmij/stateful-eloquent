# Laravel 5 Eloquent State Machine

If you're familiar with my [AASM](https://github.com/aasm/aasm), then this is a similar take â€“ just implemented in Laravel 5 for Eloquent classes.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install Through Composer

```
composer require mikerice/staetful-eloquent
```

### Step 2: Add the Service Provider

```
MikeRice\Stateful\StatefulServiceProvider::class,
```

### Step 3: Update your Eloquent Model

Your models should use the Stateful trait and interface

```
use MikeRice\Stateful\StatefulTrait;
use MikeRice\Stateful\StatefulInterface;

class Transaction extends Model implements StatefulInterface
{
    use StatefulTrait;
}
```

### Step 4: Create your Model States

Your models should have an array name `$states` that define your model states.

```
    /**
     * Transaction States
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $states = [
        'draft' => ['inital' => true],
        'processing',
        'errored',
        'active',
        'closed' => ['final' => true]
    ];
```

### Step 5 Create your Model State Transitions

```
    /**
     * Transaction State Transitions
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $transitions = [
        'process' => [
            'from' => ['draft', 'errored'],
            'to' => 'processing'
        ],
        'activate' => [
            'from' => 'processing',
            'to' => 'active'
        ],
        'fail' => [
            'from' => 'processing',
            'to' => 'errored'
        ],
        'close' => [
            'from' => 'active',
            'to' => 'close'
        ]
    ];
```
